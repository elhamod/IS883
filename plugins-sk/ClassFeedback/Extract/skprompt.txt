We have received feedback from the students and we want to assess that feedback and summarize it

The feedback below is in csv form, with the first row as column names.
The first column is for things to start.
The second column is for things to stop.
The third column is for things to continue.
The fourth column is for rating the content of the class (material, slides, assignments...).
The fifth column is for rating the instructor and teaching.

Here is the feedback:

1. How good do you think the instructor is in terms of class teaching (on a scale from 1 to 5)? Explain briefly your rating.

2. How good do you think the instructor is in terms of assignment creation (on a scale from 1 to 5)? Explain briefly your rating.

3. Identify negative feedback and ways to address it
The format should read in markdown format as:
