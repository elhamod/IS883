        "[In class](https://github.com/elhamod/IS883/blob/main/Prompt_Engineering_Agents.ipynb), we have seen the most basic form of chains, a `SequentialChain`. However, other more sophisticated chains exist. Here, you will explore a [`RouterChain`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains/foundational/router#legacy-routerchain). This chain acts like a switch. Given a condition, it decided which prompt to use. This is in contrast to the deterministic sequantial nature of `SequentialChain`.\n",

It will advise to invest their money and provide them with an investment portfolio based on their savings and using 5 stocks.\n",
        " - Otherwise, FiniBot will politely and cautiously, without taking them on a guilt trip, warn the client about their financial situation. It will then turn into a debt advisor, and create a plan for them to pay off their debt by allocating 10% of their income for monthly debt payments.\n",
