Also, make due dates for assignments on Fridays to give students the opportunity to maximize office hours during the week. One hour before a due date or the day after a due date are not good times for office hours.\",\"Stop assuming that all students can start homework assignments more than 4 days in advance, even though it gives minimal time for a response from the Professor/TA to answer questions, especially if a question comes in on a Friday before a Monday due date. Given my experience from the last homework, however, I could have sent the professor 50 emails about the assignment and likely still would not have figured it out. So I had no realistic way to complete it fully given my level of knowledge. Assignments need to be shorter and better teach theorical concepts. Most students in the class do not want to code as a career, so having everyone get stuck on 1 piece of code rather than teaching something conceptually was a waste of time for all involved. As of this moment, I strongly dislike the class not because of the material or the professor, but because of the huge amount of time I have wasted in the last month trying to learn technical things that I am not yet skilled enough to comprehend.\",\"Conceptual lectures are helpful.
