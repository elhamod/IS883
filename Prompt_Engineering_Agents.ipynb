            "Summary: ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a large language model-based chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022, which enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language. Successive prompts and replies, known as prompt engineering, are considered at each conversation stage as a context.ChatGPT is built upon either GPT-3.5 or GPT-4—members of OpenAI's proprietary series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, based on the transformer architecture developed by Google—and is fine-tuned for conversational applications using a combination of supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. ChatGPT was released as a freely available research preview, but due to its popularity, OpenAI now operates the service on a freemium model. It allows users on its free tier to access the GPT-3.5-based version. In contrast, the more advanced GPT-4 based version and priority access to newer features are provided to paid subscribers under the commercial name \"ChatGPT Plus\".\n",
            "By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users and contributing to OpenAI's valuation growing to $29 billion. Within months, Google, Baidu, and Meta accelerated the development of their competing products: Bard, Ernie Bot, and LLaMA. Microsoft launched its Bing Chat based on OpenAI's GPT-4. It raised concern among some observers over the potential of ChatGPT and similar programs to displace or atrophy human intelligence, enable plagiarism, or fuel misinformation.\n",

            "Summary: Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI, and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models. It was initially released on March 14, 2023, and has been made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, and via OpenAI's API.  As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and \"data licensed from third-party providers\" is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance.: 2 Observers reported that the iteration of ChatGPT using GPT-4 was an improvement on the previous iteration based on GPT-3.5, with the caveat that GPT-4 retains some of the problems with earlier revisions. GPT-4 is also capable of taking images as input, though this feature has not been made available since launch. OpenAI has declined to reveal various technical details and statistics about GPT-4, such as the precise size of the model.\n",

Like its predecessor GPT-2, it is a decoder-only transformer model of deep neural network, which uses attention in place of previous recurrence- and convolution-based architectures. Attention mechanisms allow the model to selectively focus on segments of input text it predicts to be the most relevant. It uses a 2048-tokens-long context and then-unprecedented size of 175 billion parameters, requiring 800GB to store. The model demonstrated strong zero-shot and few-shot learning on many tasks.Microsoft announced on September 22, 2020, that it had licensed \"exclusive\" use of GPT-3; others can still use the public API to receive output, but only Microsoft has access to GPT-3's underlying model.\u001b[0m\n",
